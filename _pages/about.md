Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am a graduate student working in experimental high energy physics at the [Center for Particles and Fields](http://www.hep.utexas.edu/cpf/), the University of Texas at Austin. My group is led by Dr. [Karol Lang](https://cns.utexas.edu/directory/item/18-physics/442-lang-karol?Itemid=349), and our focus is the study of neutrinos.

I have broad interests in physics, with a particular focus on the neutron-antineutron oscillations. This phenomenon provides a close connection between particle physics and cosmological evolution. It will help us to understand the mechanism in which the Universe transits from an early state balanced between matter and antimatter to the one that we are living today in which matter dominates. 

The search that I'm working on uses the [NOvA Far Detector](https://novaexperiment.fnal.gov/how-does-nova-work/). In particular, a neutron in the atomic nucleus that comprises the detector might rarely turn into an antineutron. This antineutron will immediately annihilate with one of the surrounding nucleons. This interaction leaves behind a star-like pattern of energy hits that can be recorded by the detector. My job is to develop an algorithm that continuously looks for and collect those patterns. A more detailed overview is on my Research page.

Besides work, I enjoy reading about Biology, especially Evolution and Genetics. In my free time, I enjoy running, jogging, and sometimes playing video games. Two favorite games are ["Ori and the Blind Forest"](https://www.orithegame.com/blind-forest/) and ["DOTA 2."](http://blog.dota2.com/?l=english)
