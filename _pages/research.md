Neutrino Oscillations (MINOS/MINOS+, NOvA)
------
Search for sterile neutrinos using the data from long-baseline neutrino oscillations experiments. In the MINOS+ experiment, two analyses were conducted with one using the data from the $\nu_e$ appearance channel and the other using the combined data from both disappearance channels of $\nu_\mu$. With the NOvA experiment, the search used only the $\nu_\mu$ neutral-current disappearance channel. Place constraints on $\Delta m_{41}^2$ and $\sin^2\theta_{\mu e}$ and compare to the LSND's and MiniBooNE's allowed regions.

Test Beam (LArIAT, NOvA Testbeam)
------
NOvA Testbeam: Lead the development (optical simulation and energy-loss simulation, optimizing the design), commissioning, and operation of the CO$_2$ Cherenkov threshold counter used to tag the electrons in the beamline. Developed analysis tools for the time-of-flight modules, the Cherenkov counter, and the beamline PID. Work as a DAQ on-call expert.

LArIAT: Involved in the development, testing, and installation of the aerogel Cherenkov counter used for $e/\mu/\pi$ separation. Lead the development, commissioning, and operation of the SiPM detector, which worked as the trigger device for the LArIAT TPC.

Neutron Antineutron Oscillation (NOvA)
------
Together with Junting Huang, a postdoc from UT Austin, develop, commission, and maintain the data-driven trigger for the $n\bar{n}$ oscillation search in NOvA. This trigger succeeded in looking for shower events of spherical topology embedded in a dominant background of cosmic rays and showers. Besides $n\bar{n}$ signal candidates, this also provides a large sample of neutron interactions, useful for the background modeling of antineutrino oscillations study. Develop the event selection to select the signal candidates. Place an upper bound on the oscillation lifetime of bound neutrons in $^{12}$C target. Study its implications on baryogenesis models.

Particle Detectors Instrumentation (LArIAT, NOvA Testbeam)
------
Developed simulations and analyses for various light detector systems (SiPMs in LAr, optical fibers in the liquid scintillator, or Cherenkov counters. Involved in data analysis for ARAPUCA (an alternative approach to DUNE FDphoto-detection) to benchmark its light collection efficiency. Design front-end electronics for silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) devices used in light collection systems. This design has been used as a trigger in the LArIAT experiment at Fermilab. This design was also utilized in the TallBo cryostat at Fermilab to compare the light collection efficiency between normal SiPMs and VUV SiPMs from Hamamatsu.
